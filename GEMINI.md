# Judgepad

## Martial arts scoring app

Judgepad is a martial arts scoring app. It is used for scoring a competitor.
The judge will use judgepad on a tablet using touch UI. It is running only locally,
with no backend.

The purpose of the app is to let the judge score partial aspects of the performance
and the app will automatically calculate the total score (max 10). There are two
competition events. The app will also remember previous scorings of the session,
but only locally.
